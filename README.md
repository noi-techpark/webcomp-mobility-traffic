docker-compose run --rm app /bin/bash -c "npm install"
```

### Start and stop the containers

Before start working you have to start the Docker containers:

```
docker-compose up --build --detach
```

After finished working you can stop the Docker containers:

```
docker-compose stop
```

### Running commands inside the container

When the containers are running, you can execute any command inside the environment. Just replace the dots `...` in the following example with the command you wish to execute:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm app /bin/bash -c "..."
